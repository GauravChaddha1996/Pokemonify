## Developer notes
We made this app on the peak popularity of Pokémon go mobile app to make our friends learn more about our 
childhood cartoons and also making funny card memes of them :)
We also learnt a lot of stuff while making this.
Things we used or learned:
* We used scraped data from [PokeApi](http://www.pokeapi.co/) about the Pokémonsn under fair use.
* We used the pokemon images under fair use from [Pokestadium.com](http://www.pokestadium.com/).
* Implementation of custom fonts and Action Bar titles for Views and Activities.
* Backgrounds was made by [Saurav Tiru](https://github.com/anonyxcali) while icons are from [Flaticon](http://www.flaticon.com/).
* It uses a SQLlite Db to store data about the Pokémon cards.
* We learned a lot about Android Db management,cropping images,saving to gallery,sharing it and oh of course
python scripts that can be found under the folder scripts here.
